# SaaS Research Multi-Agent System

A hierarchical multi-agent system built with LangChain that researches SaaS opportunities, analyzes markets, and generates comprehensive reports.

## Overview

This system uses a team of specialized AI agents coordinated by a supervisor to conduct thorough research on SaaS ideas and markets. The system analyzes:

- Market opportunities and SaaS ideas
- Competitor analysis and reviews
- Market size and growth trends
- Pain killer vs vitamin classification
- Bootstrapping feasibility
- Payment willingness
- Distribution strategies
- Business models and pricing

## Architecture

### Supervisor
Coordinates the workflow and delegates tasks to specialized agents.

### Agents

1. **SaaS Finder Agent**
   - Finds SaaS opportunities in niches/industries
   - Generates SaaS ideas
   - Evaluates pain killer vs vitamin
   - Assesses bootstrapping feasibility

2. **Researcher Agent**
   - Conducts deep market research
   - Analyzes competitors and their features
   - Gathers and analyzes user reviews
   - Identifies user pain points
   - Creates visualizations

3. **Market Analyst Agent**
   - Analyzes market size (TAM, SAM)
   - Assesses payment willingness
   - Develops distribution strategies
   - Recommends business models and pricing
   - Evaluates growth potential

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Ollama installed with `gpt-oss:20b` model
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Ensure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve
```

3. Verify the model is available:
```bash
ollama list
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter your query when prompted, for example:
- "I want to build a SaaS product in the project management niche for small teams"
- "Research the market for AI-powered customer support tools"
- "Analyze opportunities in the fitness tracking SaaS market"

The system will:
1. Process your query through the supervisor
2. Delegate tasks to appropriate agents
3. Generate a comprehensive report
4. Save the report to `output/reports/`

```

## Configuration

Edit `langchain/utils/config.py` to customize:

- Ollama model and base URL
- Output directories
- Agent temperature and max iterations

## Tools

Each agent has access to specialized tools:

- **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo search for current information
- **Competitor Analysis**: Analyze competitors in markets
- **Review Analysis**: Gather and analyze user reviews
- **Market Size Research**: Research TAM, SAM, and growth
- **Chart Generation**: Create bar charts, pie charts, and line charts
- **Analysis Tools**: Pain killer/vitamin analysis, bootstrapping feasibility, etc.

## Output

The system generates:

1. **Markdown Reports**: Comprehensive research reports saved to `output/reports/`
2. **Charts**: Visualizations saved to `output/charts/` (when generated by agents)

## Example Output

The system provides detailed analysis including:

- SaaS opportunity suggestions
- Competitor comparisons
- Market size estimates
- Pain killer/vitamin classification
- Bootstrapping assessment
- Distribution strategy recommendations
- Business model suggestions
- Pricing recommendations

## Development

The code is organized in the `langchain/` directory with clear separation of concerns:

- **Agents**: Individual agent implementations
- **Tools**: Reusable tools for agents
- **Utils**: Utilities like chart generation and configuration
- **Supervisor**: Orchestration logic

## Notes

- The system uses Ollama with the `gpt-oss:20b` model
- Charts are generated using matplotlib
- Reports are saved as Markdown files
- The supervisor coordinates agent workflow intelligently
